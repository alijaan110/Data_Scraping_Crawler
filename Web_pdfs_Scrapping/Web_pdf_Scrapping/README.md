This script is designed specifically for research purposes and uses Google Scholar to find academic PDFs. Here are the key features:

1- It searches Google Scholar, which is more likely to return research papers, reports, and academic documents.
2- It looks for both direct PDF links and "[PDF]" indicators in the search results.
3- It attempts to get the correct filename from the Content-Disposition header when downloading.
4- It includes a random delay between requests to be more respectful of the server.

To use this script:

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

Copypip install requests beautifulsoup4
!pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Run the script and enter your research keywords when prompted.

Specify how many PDFs you want to search for.
